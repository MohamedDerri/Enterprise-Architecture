# Enterprise Architecture Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for the Enterprise Architecture course! This repository contains all the lecture materials, lab exercises, and projects that were covered during the course. In this course, we explored the techniques and principles of well-designed enterprise architecture using modern frameworks, with a focus on the Spring Boot framework.

## Course Description

In this course, we delved into the fundamental concepts and practices of enterprise architecture. We studied various techniques required to build a robust enterprise architecture, including database access, flexibility, integration techniques, monitoring, configuration, and more. The Spring Boot framework served as our primary tool for implementing these techniques effectively.

## Technologies Covered

Throughout the course, we covered a wide range of technologies and frameworks relevant to enterprise architecture. These include:

- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
- Java Persistence API (JPA)
- Different JPA mappings and queries
- Transactions and transaction management
- SQL databases
- MongoDB as a NoSQL database
- REST and SOAP web services
- Messaging with JMS, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and Kafka
- Scheduling and event configuration
- Logging and monitoring using Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana
- Testing for enterprise applications

12. Lecture 12: Scheduling and Event Configuration
13. Lecture 13: Logging and Monitoring with Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana
14. Lecture 14: Testing for Enterprise Applications

## Lab Exercises

The lab exercises folder contains hands-on exercises designed to reinforce the concepts learned during the lectures. Each lab exercise focuses on a specific topic and provides step-by-step instructions on how to implement the techniques using Spring Boot. The lab exercises are organized as follows:

1. Lab Exercise 1: Database Access and Integration Techniques
2. Lab Exercise 2: Flexibility and Configuration Management
3. Lab Exercise 3: Dependency Injection (DI) with Spring Boot
4. Lab Exercise 4: JPA and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
5. Lab Exercise 5: Advanced JPA Queries and Mapping
6. Lab Exercise 6: Transactions and Transaction Management
7. Lab Exercise 7: Working with SQL Databases
8. Lab Exercise 8: MongoDB and NoSQL Databases
9. Lab Exercise 9: Building RESTful Web Services
10. Lab Exercise 10: Implementing SOAP Web Services
11. Lab Exercise 11: Messaging with JMS, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and Kafka
12. Lab Exercise 12: Scheduling and Event Configuration
13. Lab Exercise 13: Logging and Monitoring
14. Lab Exercise 14: Testing Enterprise Applications

## Projects

The projects folder contains the final project assignments that demonstrate the practical implementation of enterprise architecture concepts. In the project, we built four interconnected applications for managing a car fleet and car rental system. Each project builds upon the knowledge gained from the lectures and lab exercises and encourages the use of various technologies covered in the course.

1. Project 1: Car Fleet Management System
2. Project 2: Car Rental Service
3. Project 3: Integration and Communication Layer
4. Project 4: Monitoring and Logging System
